## Notes for Writing

This structure keeps the focus on **music and culture** (about 75% of content) while briefly covering how the platform works (about 25%). 

**Writing Style:**
- Use conversational language that explains concepts clearly
- Include examples from the website to illustrate points
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than technical "how"
- Make it accessible to readers interested in music and culture

**Key Emphasis Areas:**
- Chapter 4 is the heart of the report - deep dive into regional music
- Chapter 3 explains what makes each region's music distinctive
- Keep technical details minimal and focused on user experience
- Use screenshots and examples from the platform throughout
