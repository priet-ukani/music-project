Asset Collection & Curation (Prerequisite)
Before any code is written, a comprehensive library of high-quality, properly licensed media must be acquired.

1. Sourcing Guidelines

Primary Sources:

Images: Google Images (use Tools > Usage Rights > "Creative Commons licenses"), Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons.

Audio & Video: YouTube (filter by "Creative Commons"), Archive.org, Freesound.org (for ambient sounds).

Attribution (Critical):

Create a central ATTRIBUTIONS.md file.

For every single file (audio, image, video) you download or link to, log its name, the direct source URL, the author/creator, and its specific license (e.g., "CC BY-SA 4.0").

2. Required Audio Assets

Ambient Sounds: 1-2 minute seamless loops (MP3/OGG).

Examples: desert_wind_loop.mp3, river_flowing.mp3, temple_bells_distant.mp3, village_ambience.mp3.

Isolated Instrument Tracks: Clean, high-quality recordings (WAV/MP3). These are crucial for the mixer and demonstrations.

Examples: sitar_solo.wav, tabla_isolated_beat.wav, kamaycha_phrase.mp3, algoza_loop.mp3, dholak_track.wav.

Full Ensemble Recordings: Complete folk, classical, or ritual songs.

Examples: rajasthani_folk_ensemble.mp3, baul_song.mp3, carnatic_trio.mp3.

Multi-tracks (Stems): If possible, find "stems" (separate tracks for each instrument in an ensemble). This is the ideal for the "Remix" feature. If not, you will simulate it by layering the isolated tracks.

3. Required Visual Assets

Landscape & Parallax: High-resolution images that can be layered.

Examples: Photos of mountains, deserts (e.g., "Thar Desert"), rivers (e.g., "Ganges"), rice paddies, temple architecture.

Instrument Galleries:

High-Res Photos: Clear shots of each instrument (e.g., sitar_full_body.jpg).

Close-Ups: Details of materials (e.g., tabla_skin_texture.jpg, sitar_carving.jpg).

360° Photos/Multiple Angles: Acquire photos from the front, back, side, and top of each key instrument.

Cultural & Contextual Galleries:

Festivals: diwali_celebration.jpg, bihu_dance.jpg, navratri_garba.jpg.

Costumes: High-res photos of traditional attire (e.g., kathakali_makeup.jpg).

Performance Context: musicians_in_courtyard.jpg, temple_performance.jpg.

Archival: Black & white or vintage photos of musicians.

4. Required Video Assets (Links & Attributions)

Performance Videos: Embeddable YouTube/Vimeo links (filtered for Creative Commons).

Instrument Construction: "How it's made" videos (e.g., "sitar making," "how a tabla is made").

5. File Organization Create a logical directory structure to store the downloaded assets.

/public/assets/
├── audio/
│   ├── ambient/
│   ├── instruments/
│   └── ensembles/
├── images/
│   ├── landscapes/
│   ├── instruments/
│   ├── cultural/
│   └── archival/
└── ATTRIBUTIONS.md
Phase 2: Feature Implementation
Once the assets from Phase 1 are collected and organized, development can begin on the following features.

1. AUDIO LAYER SYSTEM

Background ambient sounds: Clicking on a region starts subtle ambient audio (e.g., desert wind for Rajasthan, river sounds for Bengal) from the audio/ambient/ directory.

Instrument demonstrations: Isolated tracks for each instrument (from audio/instruments/).

Full ensemble recordings: Complete performances (from audio/ensembles/).

A/B comparison player: Allow users to select and compare two regions' core sounds side-by-side.

2. VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS

Hero section: Full-screen animated map with particles/connections.

Parallax scrolling: Use the images/landscapes/ assets to create layered scrolling effects (mountains, rivers, deserts).

Image galleries: High-res photo galleries using assets from images/instruments/ and images/cultural/.

Video integration: Embed performance and construction videos (from the curated link list).

360° photos: Use the multi-angle instrument photos to create an interactive viewer.

3. INTERACTIVE AUDIO FEATURES

Waveform visualizations: Use Wavesurfer.js to draw waveforms for all playing audio.

Spectrogram view: Toggleable view to show frequency patterns.

"Remix" feature: Allow adjustment of volumes for different isolated instruments to simulate an ensemble (critical for "Soundscape Mixer").

Looping sections: Allow users to select and loop a part of a waveform for focused listening.

Slow-down/speed-up: Playback speed control without pitch change.

Annotations: Clickable markers on the waveform to highlight specific musical phrases (e.g., "Tihai," "Main melody").

4. CULTURAL IMAGERY

Festival photo carousels: Use assets from images/cultural/ (Diwali, Bihu, Navratri).

Traditional costume galleries: Showcase regional attire.

Instrument close-ups: Use the high-res material/texture shots.

Performance context photos: (temples, courtyards, stages).

Historical archival photos: Use images/archival/ assets.

5. SOUNDSCAPE MIXER

Allow users to create custom soundscapes by layering audio.

Process: Select a region (loads ambient sound) → add instruments (loads isolated tracks from audio/instruments/) → adjust individual volumes.

Example: "Create a Rajasthani ensemble" (kamaycha + dholak + algoza).

Features: Save and share custom mixes.

Presets: "Classical Concert," "Folk Festival," "Temple Ritual."

6. ACCESSIBILITY

Text descriptions: For all audio ("melancholic Baul song about spiritual longing").

Visual representations of rhythm: Animated beat circles for key rhythms.

Closed captions: For all video content.

High contrast mode: For visually impaired users.

Phase 3: Technical Stack & Implementation
Audio Visualization: Wavesurfer.js

Audio Playback: Howler.js (for managing multiple audio layers, ambient sounds, and mixer).

Video: React Player (for YouTube/Vimeo embeds).

Animation: Framer Motion (for smooth transitions, parallax, and map animations).

Performance: Lazy loading for all media assets (images, audio files) to ensure fast initial load.
