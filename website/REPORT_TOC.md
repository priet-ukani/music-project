*   2.1.2 **Categorization:** Analyzing events through lenses of *Tradition*, *Patronage*, *Movements*, and *Technological Shifts* (e.g., The Gramophone Revolution of 1902).

**2.2 Key Historical Epochs**
*   2.2.1 **The Ancient Foundations:** The *Natya Shastra* (200 CE) as the codification of *Rasa* and *Tala*.
*   2.2.2 **The Medieval Divergence (1400 CE):** Tracing the split between *Hindustani* (Persian influence) and *Carnatic* systems.
*   2.2.3 **The Bhakti Movement (1300-1600 CE):** The democratization of music through saints like *Kabir* and *Tyagaraja*, establishing the *Guru-Shishya Parampara*.

**2.3 Modern Transformations**
*   2.3.1 **The Colonial Shift:** The institutionalization of music via *All India Radio* (1927) and the *Madras Music Season*.
*   2.3.2 **The Contemporary Era:** From *Coke Studio* fusion to the digital preservation of endangered folk forms.

### **Part 3: The Methodology of Mapping – Systematizing Culture**

**3.1 The Digital Ethnomusicologist’s Challenge**
*   3.1.1 Moving beyond the "Classical vs. Folk" binary.
*   3.1.2 The necessity of a multi-dimensional data structure for archiving oral traditions.

**3.2 The 6-Vector Framework**
*   3.2.1 **Geography:** How the **Thar Desert** shaped the projection of Rajasthani vocals vs. how the **Riverine Delta** of Bengal influenced the fluid melodies of Bhatiali.
*   3.2.2 **Language:** The phonetic impact of **Dravidian** (Tamil/Malayalam) vs. **Indo-Aryan** (Punjabi/Hindi) languages on musical articulation.
*   3.2.3 **Instruments:** Classification into *Tata* (Chordophones), *Avanaddha* (Membranophones), *Sushira* (Aerophones), and *Ghana* (Idiophones).
*   3.2.4 **Musical Structure:** Documenting the transition from Folk Modes to formalized Ragas.
*   3.2.5 **Performance Context:** From the **Temple Sanctum** (Kerala) to the **Harvest Field** (Punjab).
*   3.2.6 **Social Context:** Mapping the hereditary lineages (*Gharanas* and *Sampradayas*) and the sociology of caste in music (e.g., The **Manganiyar** patronage system).
